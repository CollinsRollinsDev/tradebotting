      <p>
        <strong>Welcome to TradeBotting version 1.5</strong>. This is the second
        release of the first version. As we all know, crypto currencies are
        voliatle and can not be 100% accurately predictable by humans. Same goes
        for the bot. However, this bot will try predict the best possible
        outcome of the future prices of cryptos based on some factors behind the
        scenes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having said this, we are making it clear that we are in no way liable
        for any lost funds of any kind that may be in any way connected to this
        application. You are adviced to trade on with funds you are ready to
        loose to avoid "stories that touches the heart". TRADE AT YOUR OWN RISK!
      </p>
      <p>
        Nevertheless, this bot is promising and can deliver beyond expectations.
        The application is still in better phrase and there may be a lot of bug
        fixings which may affect user-experience. We apologise for any
        incovinences in advance.
      </p>
      <h3>How To Use</h3>
      <p>
        Usage is pretty simple as the application is designed to be
        user-friendly. For the meantime, you are limited to some certain
        features of the app and more updatea will roll out soon enough.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, to check for the price of Bitcoin, Ethereum and Binance Coin in a
        glimps, just access the app's dashboard and it is visble there for quick
        grasp. Other interfaces in the dashboard such as records an community
        are going to be functional in the later version prior to their
        development/implementations.
      </p>
      <p>
        To check for the future price and predict, as well as get the advice of
        the system, head over to Trade-Area from the menu and select your coin,
        intervals and currency you wanna get your result.
      </p>
      <p>
        The data of your selected crypto will be out in no time. Then, you have
        two option to get advice fron the system. For now, only surface scan is
        supported as we are working on the deep scan for later updates.
      </p>
      <h3>Is Payment Involve?</h3>
      <p>
        No! We plan to implement such but not anytime soon. All access to the
        site are completly free.
      </p>
      <h3>When Is The Next Update?</h3>
      <p>
        We can't say for sure. But based on our calendar, next update might be
        dropping on 26th June, 2021. We will alert you of the new update as well
        as the updated features.
      </p>
      <h3>What Happens To The Older TradeBotting v 1.0 Using Another Domain</h3>
      <p>
        That will in no way be affected. It can still be used but will be very
        outdated as compared to this current one. We plan to keep that for
        record purpose.
      </p>
